                I have played soccer almost my entire life. I played on AYSO until I was 8, and then started to
                play club for Chicago Northwind. I always wanted to be the kid that punted the ball, so I started playing gaolkeeper.
                I played Northwind for 6 years before my team started to fall apart. 
                We went 1-16-7 my last season with Northwind. I became really close with all my teamates, but I needed to make
                something better for myself. I decided to move to a club way up north call FC United. I just finished my first season with them,
                and I made the right choice moving clubs. We finished in a very tough Elite 64 league 4-4, and made it to the state cup.

                I started playing softball in 5th grade at Hamlin Park. I played catch with my dad in the backyard all the time, but I want to start playing seriously. After my first season with Hamlin House league, 
                I decided to start playing travel there. I developed as a third baseman and a catcher. My favorite feeling was throwing out people that were trying to steal.
                I played travel for 2 years, and then before high school started, I quit so I could play soccer. At Lane Tech,
                I have a much better chance of making the soccer team rather than the softball team.
