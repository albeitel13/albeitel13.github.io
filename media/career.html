                <p>I plan on getting a career with something to do with STEM Engineering. Right now in school,
                    I really enjoy science and math. I believe that I can build on these skills as I get later in life 
                    and get a job in engineering. More specifically, I would like to pursue a career in Mechanincal Engineering.
                    Both my parents are mechanical engineers, and they have made a very good living. I am very methodical with
                    lots of things that I do. At home, the small details matter to me, such as how dishes are laid in the dishwasher.
                    I think that with the skills that I currentlu have, and the skills I will gain throughout high school and college,
                    I can make a living out of being a mechanical engineer.

                <p>One university that I have in mind is the University of Michigan 
                in Ann Arbor, Michigan. As a top 10 ranked engineering program in the nation,
                the University of Michigan offers a fantastic education of engineering. Also, the University of Michigan
            is a very versitile school, so if I ended up not having a passion for engineering, then I could switch my
        major to something else that they offer.</p>

                <p>A second university that I have in mind is Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Duke University
                    has a very highly ranked mechanincal engineering program, 25th to be exact. Also, 83% of students recieve 
                    a job offer right out of gradutation. I have visited Duke University a couple of times, and I really like the campus as well.
                    I think that it is the right size, and the buildings are very pretty.
